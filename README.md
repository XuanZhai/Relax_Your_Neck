# Relax Your Neck
Relax your neck is a single endless runner game that allows users to navigate the mustang and avoid obstacles to run as far as they can. Users can control the navigation of the mustang by moving their heads up and down to stretch their necks. However, unlike other endless running games, our game is kept at an average uniform speed to prevent any injury during our game. Users can open up the game and check if their daily goal is fulfilled. They have to achieve either the step goal or the game goal to ensure they have enough exercise.
